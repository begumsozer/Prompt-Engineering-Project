Prompt Engineering Review Triage Project

This project is part of the MIT No Code AI Certificate Program. The goal of the project is to develop an automated review triage system using prompt engineering techniques and generative AI. The project focuses on customer feedback in the restaurant industry, applying structured prompting strategies to classify reviews and generate actionable business insights.

Project Overview:

-Restaurants often receive open-ended customer reviews across platforms like Yelp, Google, and internal surveys. Manual analysis of these reviews is time-consuming, inconsistent, and subjective.

-Objective: Use Generative AI to automatically:

-Classify the sentiment of each review (Positive / Neutral / Negative)

-Extract key aspects mentioned (e.g., Food Quality, Service)

-Determine the urgency level (High / Normal / Low)

-Recommend an appropriate customer service action

-Generate a consistent, brand-aligned first reply

Dataset Details:
